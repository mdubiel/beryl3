## TODO Processing Workflow

When user says "process TODO", execute the following workflow:

### Process:
1. **Read TODO.md file** to get the list of tasks
2. **Take tasks one by one** in order
3. **Complete each assignment** treating each item as a complete prompt/request
4. **Create detailed reports** in `docs/reports/taskxxx.md` documenting the work performed
5. **Mark items as fixed** in TODO.md (change format or add status)
6. **Proceed to next task** until all are completed

### Report Format:
- File: `docs/reports/task001.md`, `task002.md`, etc.
- Include: task description, analysis, changes made, verification steps, outcome
- Document all code changes, file modifications, deployment steps

### Task Completion:
- Mark completed tasks in TODO.md
- Ensure all changes are tested and working
- Create comprehensive documentation for each task

This workflow ensures systematic completion of all TODO items with proper documentation and verification.
