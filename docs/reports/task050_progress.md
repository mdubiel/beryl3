# Task 50: Add Custom Item Fields (Location and Your ID) - Progress Report

## Status: ✅ Implementation Complete, Ready for Final Testing

**Date Started:** 2025-10-22
**Date Completed:** 2025-10-22
**Current State:** All features implemented and working, final testing in progress

---

## Overview

Task 50 adds two new custom fields to CollectionItem:
- **Your ID**: A custom user-defined identifier for personal cataloging with smart suggestions
- **Location**: Physical location tracking with dropdown selection and management

---

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### Backend Implementation

#### 1. Location Model Created
**File:** `webapp/web/models.py`

```python
class Location(BaseModel):
    """Physical location where collection items are stored."""
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    description = models.TextField(blank=True, default="")
    created_by = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="locations")

    class Meta:
        ordering = ['name']
        unique_together = [['created_by', 'name']]
```

#### 2. CollectionItem Fields Added
**File:** `webapp/web/models.py`

Added to CollectionItem model:
```python
your_id = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True, default="", help_text="Your personal identifier for this item")
location = models.ForeignKey('Location', on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True, blank=True, related_name='items')
```

#### 3. Migration Created
**File:** `webapp/web/migrations/0032_add_location_and_custom_fields.py`
- ⚠️ **Status:** Migration file created but NOT YET APPLIED to database

#### 4. Location Views Implemented
**File:** `webapp/web/views/location.py` (NEW)

Implemented views:
- `location_list_view` - List all user's locations with item counts
- `location_items_view` - View items in specific location
- `location_create_view` - Create new location
- `location_update_view` - Edit existing location
- `location_delete_view` - Delete location (with proper item cleanup for soft delete)

**File:** `webapp/web/views/items_hx.py` (UPDATED)

Task 50 HTMX views for inline editing:
- `item_edit_your_id` - Show form to edit Your ID with smart suggestions
- `item_edit_location` - Show form to edit Location with dropdown
- `item_save_personal_info` - Save Your ID or Location changes

#### 5. Forms Updated
**File:** `webapp/web/forms.py`

Updated `CollectionItemForm`:
- Added `your_id` and `location` fields
- Location queryset filtered to user's own locations
- Uses standard Django ModelForm (no autocomplete)

#### 6. URL Routes Added
**File:** `webapp/web/urls.py`

New routes:
```python
path('locations/', views.location_list_view, name='location_list'),
path('locations/new/', views.location_create_view, name='location_create'),
path('locations/<str:hash>/', views.location_items_view, name='location_items'),
path('locations/<str:hash>/edit/', views.location_update_view, name='location_update'),
path('locations/<str:hash>/delete/', views.location_delete_view, name='location_delete'),

# Task 50: Personal information (Your ID and Location) management
path('items/<str:hash>/edit-your-id/', items_hx.item_edit_your_id, name='item_edit_your_id'),
path('items/<str:hash>/edit-location/', items_hx.item_edit_location, name='item_edit_location'),
path('items/<str:hash>/save-personal-info/', items_hx.item_save_personal_info, name='item_save_personal_info'),
```

**Note:** Location selection uses a simple dropdown with user's existing locations (no autocomplete endpoint needed).

### Frontend Implementation

#### 7. Templates Created
**Directory:** `webapp/templates/location/` (NEW)

Created templates:
- `location_list.html` - List all locations with item counts and actions
- `location_items.html` - View all items in a specific location
- `location_form.html` - Create/edit location form
- `location_confirm_delete.html` - Delete confirmation dialog

**Directory:** `webapp/templates/partials/` (NEW)

Personal information editing partials:
- `_item_personal_info.html` - Display Your ID and Location with edit buttons
- `_item_edit_your_id.html` - Form to edit Your ID with smart suggestions
- `_item_edit_location.html` - Form to edit Location with dropdown

#### 8. Templates Updated

**File:** `webapp/templates/base.html`
- Added "My Locations" link to user menu

**File:** `webapp/templates/items/item_detail.html`
- Reordered sections: Personal Information → Attributes → Links
- Includes personal info partial for owner-only display
- Added modal for editing personal information

## ✅ Issues Fixed During Implementation

1. **Icon Validation** ✅
   - Fixed `more-vertical` → `ellipsis` in location_list.html
   - Added icon validation guidelines to CLAUDE.md
   - All icons verified: `ellipsis`, `pencil`, `save`, `map-pin`, `user`, `list`, `link`, `info`, `history`

2. **Template Syntax Error** ✅
   - Fixed Django template parentheses issue in item_detail.html
   - Changed from `{% if a and (b or c) %}` to nested if statements

3. **Attributes Section Missing** ✅
   - Removed conditional that hid Attributes when no item_type
   - Attributes now always visible to owners with "+ Add Attribute" button

4. **Section Organization** ✅
   - Reordered: Personal Information → Attributes → Links
   - Added icons to all section headers

5. **Location Deletion Issue** ✅
   - Fixed soft delete not clearing item references
   - Added manual cleanup: `CollectionItem.objects.filter(location=location).update(location=None)`
   - Template handles soft-deleted locations gracefully

6. **URL Naming Convention** ✅
   - Verified no `/api/` paths used (reserved for future API)
   - All HTMX endpoints follow pattern: `items/<hash>/edit-your-id/`

7. **ID Suggestions Implementation** ✅ (2025-10-25)
   - Moved from inline code to `CollectionItem.predict_next_id()` model method
   - Supports 4 pattern types: numeric, prefix+separator, letters+numbers, numbers+letters
   - Preserves leading zeros in numeric patterns
   - Changed UI from alert box with buttons to input placeholder
   - Help text shows suggested ID and last used value

8. **Z-Index Modal Issue** ✅ (2025-10-25)
   - Changed from inline `style="z-index: 9999;"` to Tailwind `z-[9999]` class
   - Updated combobox documentation
   - Ensures autocomplete dropdown always appears above modals

9. **Collection List View Display** ✅ (2025-10-25)
   - Added Your ID and Location display to `_item_list_item.html`
   - Positioned in bottom right corner with subtle styling
   - Owner-only display using conditional rendering
   - Uses `hash` icon for Your ID, `map-pin` icon for Location
   - Small text size (`text-xs`) with reduced opacity (`text-base-content/60`)

10. **Inline Editing (No Modal)** ✅ (2025-10-25)
   - Replaced modal-based editing with inline editing for both Your ID and Location
   - Edit button replaces table row with inline form
   - Buttons in same row: [Clear] [Cancel] [Save]
   - No z-index issues - autocomplete works perfectly without modal
   - Created new templates: `_item_edit_your_id_inline.html`, `_item_edit_location_inline.html`
   - Added new views: `item_edit_your_id_inline`, `item_edit_location_inline`, `item_reload_personal_info`

11. **ID Suggestion Display Improvements** ✅ (2025-10-25)
   - Show suggestion only in edit mode (not in display view)
   - Added to inline edit forms as placeholder and help text
   - Added to main item create/edit form (`/items/add/`, `/items/<hash>/edit`)
   - Suggestion shown as input placeholder for better UX

12. **Autocomplete Multi-Context Support** ✅ (2025-10-25)
   - Updated `_location_autocomplete_results.html` to detect context dynamically
   - Supports three contexts: modal (`location`), inline (`inline-location`), form (`form-location`)
   - Autocomplete now works in all three contexts without conflicts

13. **Location Link to Items List** ✅ (2025-10-25)
   - Location in collection list view now links to `/locations/<hash>/` (items in that location)
   - Changed from vertical to horizontal layout (one line)
   - Added hover effect for better UX

14. **Form Submit Handler for Manual Entry** ✅ (2025-10-25)
   - Added JavaScript to ensure manually typed location names are submitted
   - Copies typed value from search field to `location_name` hidden field on submit
   - Allows creating new locations by typing name without selecting from autocomplete

## Technical Notes

### Location Selection
- Uses simple `<select>` dropdown (no autocomplete)
- Filtered to show only user's own locations
- Link to create new location opens in new tab
- Prevents duplicates via `unique_together` constraint (created_by, name)

### Your ID Smart Suggestions
The system analyzes the last used ID and suggests the next value:
- **Implementation**: `CollectionItem.predict_next_id()` model method
- **Numeric patterns**: `123` → suggests `124` (preserves leading zeros)
- **Prefix + separator patterns**: `ABC-123` → suggests `ABC-124`, `ID_42` → `ID_43`
- **Letter+number patterns**: `ID42` → suggests `ID43`, `BOOK007` → `BOOK008`
- **Number+letter patterns**: `42A` → suggests `43A`
- **Display**: Suggestion shown as input placeholder
- **Help text**: Shows both suggested next ID and last used value below input

### Soft Delete Handling
- Location uses soft delete (BerylModel with `is_deleted` flag)
- `on_delete=SET_NULL` doesn't fire on soft delete
- **Solution**: Manually clear item references before soft delete
- Template gracefully handles soft-deleted locations with strikethrough display

### Privacy Considerations
- `your_id` and `location` only visible to item owner
- Not shown in public collection views
- Location queryset filtered by user

### Database Schema
```
Location:
  - id (PK)
  - hash (unique)
  - name (max_length=200)
  - description (text, optional)
  - created_by (FK to User)
  - created_at, updated_at (timestamps)
  - UNIQUE(created_by, name)

CollectionItem (new fields):
  - your_id (varchar(100), optional)
  - location (FK to Location, nullable)
```
