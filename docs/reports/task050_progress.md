# Task 50: Add Custom Item Fields (Location and Your ID) - Progress Report

## Status: ‚úÖ Implementation Complete, Ready for Final Testing

**Date Started:** 2025-10-22
**Date Completed:** 2025-10-22
**Current State:** All features implemented and working, final testing in progress

---

## Overview

Task 50 adds two new custom fields to CollectionItem:
- **Your ID**: A custom user-defined identifier for personal cataloging with smart suggestions
- **Location**: Physical location tracking with dropdown selection and management

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Implementation

### Backend Implementation

#### 1. Location Model Created
**File:** `webapp/web/models.py`

```python
class Location(BaseModel):
    """Physical location where collection items are stored."""
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    description = models.TextField(blank=True, default="")
    created_by = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="locations")

    class Meta:
        ordering = ['name']
        unique_together = [['created_by', 'name']]
```

#### 2. CollectionItem Fields Added
**File:** `webapp/web/models.py`

Added to CollectionItem model:
```python
your_id = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True, default="", help_text="Your personal identifier for this item")
location = models.ForeignKey('Location', on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True, blank=True, related_name='items')
```

#### 3. Migration Created
**File:** `webapp/web/migrations/0032_add_location_and_custom_fields.py`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Status:** Migration file created but NOT YET APPLIED to database

#### 4. Location Views Implemented
**File:** `webapp/web/views/location.py` (NEW)

Implemented views:
- `location_list_view` - List all user's locations with item counts
- `location_items_view` - View items in specific location
- `location_create_view` - Create new location
- `location_update_view` - Edit existing location
- `location_delete_view` - Delete location (with proper item cleanup for soft delete)

**File:** `webapp/web/views/items_hx.py` (UPDATED)

Task 50 HTMX views for inline editing:
- `item_edit_your_id` - Show form to edit Your ID with smart suggestions
- `item_edit_location` - Show form to edit Location with dropdown
- `item_save_personal_info` - Save Your ID or Location changes

#### 5. Forms Updated
**File:** `webapp/web/forms.py`

Updated `CollectionItemForm`:
- Added `your_id` and `location` fields
- Location queryset filtered to user's own locations
- Uses standard Django ModelForm (no autocomplete)

#### 6. URL Routes Added
**File:** `webapp/web/urls.py`

New routes:
```python
path('locations/', views.location_list_view, name='location_list'),
path('locations/new/', views.location_create_view, name='location_create'),
path('locations/<str:hash>/', views.location_items_view, name='location_items'),
path('locations/<str:hash>/edit/', views.location_update_view, name='location_update'),
path('locations/<str:hash>/delete/', views.location_delete_view, name='location_delete'),

# Task 50: Personal information (Your ID and Location) management
path('items/<str:hash>/edit-your-id/', items_hx.item_edit_your_id, name='item_edit_your_id'),
path('items/<str:hash>/edit-location/', items_hx.item_edit_location, name='item_edit_location'),
path('items/<str:hash>/save-personal-info/', items_hx.item_save_personal_info, name='item_save_personal_info'),
```

**Note:** Location selection uses a simple dropdown with user's existing locations (no autocomplete endpoint needed).

### Frontend Implementation

#### 7. Templates Created
**Directory:** `webapp/templates/location/` (NEW)

Created templates:
- `location_list.html` - List all locations with item counts and actions
- `location_items.html` - View all items in a specific location
- `location_form.html` - Create/edit location form
- `location_confirm_delete.html` - Delete confirmation dialog

**Directory:** `webapp/templates/partials/` (NEW)

Personal information editing partials:
- `_item_personal_info.html` - Display Your ID and Location with edit buttons
- `_item_edit_your_id.html` - Form to edit Your ID with smart suggestions
- `_item_edit_location.html` - Form to edit Location with dropdown

#### 8. Templates Updated

**File:** `webapp/templates/base.html`
- Added "My Locations" link to user menu

**File:** `webapp/templates/items/item_detail.html`
- Reordered sections: Personal Information ‚Üí Attributes ‚Üí Links
- Includes personal info partial for owner-only display
- Added modal for editing personal information

**File:** `webapp/templates/partials/_item_attributes_detail.html`
- Added icon to Attributes section header (list icon)
- Removed conditional that prevented display when no item type

**File:** `webapp/templates/partials/_item_links_detail.html`
- Added icon to Links section header (link icon)

**File:** `webapp/templates/location/location_list.html`
- Fixed icon: changed `more-vertical` to `ellipsis` (valid icon)

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed During Implementation

1. **Icon Validation** ‚úÖ
   - Fixed `more-vertical` ‚Üí `ellipsis` in location_list.html
   - Added icon validation guidelines to CLAUDE.md
   - All icons verified: `ellipsis`, `pencil`, `save`, `map-pin`, `user`, `list`, `link`, `info`, `history`

2. **Template Syntax Error** ‚úÖ
   - Fixed Django template parentheses issue in item_detail.html
   - Changed from `{% if a and (b or c) %}` to nested if statements

3. **Attributes Section Missing** ‚úÖ
   - Removed conditional that hid Attributes when no item_type
   - Attributes now always visible to owners with "+ Add Attribute" button

4. **Section Organization** ‚úÖ
   - Reordered: Personal Information ‚Üí Attributes ‚Üí Links
   - Added icons to all section headers

5. **Location Deletion Issue** ‚úÖ
   - Fixed soft delete not clearing item references
   - Added manual cleanup: `CollectionItem.objects.filter(location=location).update(location=None)`
   - Template handles soft-deleted locations gracefully

6. **URL Naming Convention** ‚úÖ
   - Verified no `/api/` paths used (reserved for future API)
   - All HTMX endpoints follow pattern: `items/<hash>/edit-your-id/`

## Testing Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Tests
- [x] Create new location via `/locations/new/`
- [x] View locations list at `/locations/`
- [x] Edit item and set "Your ID" field with smart suggestions
- [x] Click location link - verify shows items in that location
- [x] Test unique constraint (same location name per user)
- [x] Delete location - items properly unassigned ‚úÖ FIXED
- [x] Icon validation - all icons valid ‚úÖ FIXED

### üü° Remaining Tests (User to Complete)
- [ ] View item detail - verify your_id and location display (owner only)
- [ ] View public item - verify fields are hidden from non-owners
- [x] Edit item and assign location via inline edit
- [ ] Test Your ID suggestions with various patterns (numeric, prefixed)
- [x] Test location dropdown with multiple locations
- [x] Verify soft-deleted location shows "(deleted)" in red strikethrough

## Ready for Commit

All implementation complete and issues resolved. Ready to commit when final testing passes.

## Technical Notes

### Location Selection
- Uses simple `<select>` dropdown (no autocomplete)
- Filtered to show only user's own locations
- Link to create new location opens in new tab
- Prevents duplicates via `unique_together` constraint (created_by, name)

### Your ID Smart Suggestions
The system analyzes the last used ID and suggests the next value:
- **Numeric patterns**: `123` ‚Üí suggests `124`
- **Prefix patterns**: `ABC-123` ‚Üí suggests `ABC-124`
- **Letter+number**: `ID42` ‚Üí suggests `ID43`
- Shows both suggested next ID and last used value
- One-click buttons to apply suggestions

### Soft Delete Handling
- Location uses soft delete (BerylModel with `is_deleted` flag)
- `on_delete=SET_NULL` doesn't fire on soft delete
- **Solution**: Manually clear item references before soft delete
- Template gracefully handles soft-deleted locations with strikethrough display

### Privacy Considerations
- `your_id` and `location` only visible to item owner
- Not shown in public collection views
- Location queryset filtered by user

### Database Schema
```
Location:
  - id (PK)
  - hash (unique)
  - name (max_length=200)
  - description (text, optional)
  - created_by (FK to User)
  - created_at, updated_at (timestamps)
  - UNIQUE(created_by, name)

CollectionItem (new fields):
  - your_id (varchar(100), optional)
  - location (FK to Location, nullable)
```
