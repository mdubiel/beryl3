## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema
```sql
-- UserProfile model added to web app
CREATE TABLE web_userprofile (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER UNIQUE REFERENCES auth_user(id),
    receive_marketing_emails BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    resend_audience_id VARCHAR(100),
    unsubscribe_token VARCHAR(64),
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Secure Unsubscribe Flow**: Token-based system without login requirement
2. **Resend API Integration**: Full audience management with error handling
3. **Admin Management**: Comprehensive sys interface with statistics and bulk actions
4. **User Settings**: Clean, accessible interface for personal preferences
5. **Automatic Synchronization**: Real-time sync between Django and Resend
6. **GDPR Compliance**: Easy removal and consent management tools

### Environment Configuration
- Uses existing `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable
- Audience ID: `01f8fa37-6d40-4f54-b59e-f8fc465898e2`
- Graceful degradation when API key not configured

## Testing and Verification

### Database Migration Status
✅ All migrations applied successfully
✅ UserProfile model properly integrated
✅ No pending migrations

### URL Routing Verification
✅ `/user/settings/` - User account settings
✅ `/sys/marketing-consent/` - Admin management
✅ `/unsubscribe/<token>/` - Secure unsubscribe
✅ User context menu navigation updated

### Feature Functionality
✅ User profile automatic creation
✅ Marketing email preference handling
✅ Resend API integration (when configured)
✅ Admin bulk operations
✅ Secure token generation and validation

## Next Steps Recommended
1. Configure `RESEND_API_KEY` in production environment
2. Test email subscription/unsubscription flow in staging
3. Verify Resend audience synchronization in production
4. Monitor admin interface for consent management efficiency
