# Task 004 Report: Create Email Queue Management View

## Task Description
Create a new view in 'SYS' to display the email queue, together with crontab information, and information about when it was recently flushed. Also provide a button to manually trigger queue processing. Add a link to this view in SYS "System modules" section.

## Analysis
The application uses `post_office` for queued email sending with Django. This system provides:
- Email queuing with status tracking (sent, failed, queued, requeued)
- Management commands: `send_queued_mail` and `cleanup_mail`
- Email model with full metadata (created, sent, recipients, status, priority)

The task requires creating a comprehensive interface to:
1. Monitor email queue statistics and health
2. View recent email activity
3. Manually trigger queue processing
4. Clean up old emails
5. Display recommended cron configuration

## Changes Made

### 1. **Backend Views Implementation**
File: `webapp/web/views/sys.py`

#### Added Imports:
```python
from post_office.models import Email, EmailTemplate
```

#### Created Views:

**A. `sys_email_queue(request)` - Main Queue Dashboard**
- Displays comprehensive email statistics (total, pending, sent, failed)
- Shows queue health status with stale email detection
- Lists recent 100 emails with full metadata
- Tracks last sent and last failed email timestamps
- Health monitoring with color-coded status indicators

**B. `sys_email_queue_process(request)` - Manual Queue Processing**
- POST endpoint to trigger `send_queued_mail` management command
- Captures command output to count processed emails
- Provides user feedback via success/error messages
- Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging

**C. `sys_email_queue_cleanup(request)` - Email Cleanup**
- POST endpoint to trigger `cleanup_mail` management command
- Configurable cleanup period (7, 30, 90 days)
- User feedback and comprehensive logging
- Batch cleanup to maintain database performance

### 2. **URL Configuration**
File: `webapp/web/urls.py`

Added email queue URL patterns:
```python
path('sys/email-queue/', sys.sys_email_queue, name='sys_email_queue'),
path('sys/email-queue/process/', sys.sys_email_queue_process, name='sys_email_queue_process'),
path('sys/email-queue/cleanup/', sys.sys_email_queue_cleanup, name='sys_email_queue_cleanup'),
```

### 3. **Navigation Integration**
File: `webapp/templates/base_sys.html`

Added Email Queue link to System Modules section:
```html
<a href="{% url 'sys_email_queue' %}" class="terminal-menu-item block px-3 py-2 text-sm terminal-text">
    {% lucide 'send' size=14 class='inline mr-2' %} Email Queue
</a>
```

### 4. **Frontend Interface**
File: `webapp/templates/sys/email_queue.html`

Created comprehensive email queue management interface with:

#### A. **Statistics Dashboard**
- 4-card layout showing total, pending, sent, and failed email counts
- Color-coded status indicators (success, warning, error)
- Real-time queue health monitoring

#### B. **Management Actions**
- "Process Queue Now" button for manual processing
- Dropdown cleanup menu with multiple time periods (7, 30, 90 days)
- Form-based POST actions with CSRF protection

#### C. **Queue Health Monitoring**
- Health status badges (healthy, warning, critical)
- Stale email detection (emails older than 1 hour)
- Last sent and failed email timestamps

#### D. **Cron Configuration Guide**
- Display of recommended crontab entries
- Production-ready configuration examples:
  - Queue processing: every minute
  - Cleanup: weekly on Sundays at 2 AM

#### E. **Recent Activity Table**
- Last 100 emails with full details
- Status, priority, creation time, sent time
- Recipient and subject information
- Status badges with color coding

## Technical Implementation Details

### Email Status Mapping
Used post_office numeric status constants:
- `0` = sent (success badge)
- `1` = failed (error badge) 
- `2` = queued (warning badge)
- `3` = requeued (info badge)

### Queue Health Logic
```python
stale_emails = Email.objects.filter(
    status__in=[2, 3],  # queued + requeued
    created__lt=timezone.now() - timedelta(hours=1)
).count()

queue_health = (
    'healthy' if stale_emails == 0 
    else 'warning' if stale_emails < 10 
    else 'critical'
)
```

### Security Features
- Application admin authentication required
- POST method restrictions for state-changing operations  
- CSRF protection on all forms
- Input validation for cleanup parameters

### Logging Integration
All actions logged with structured data for Grafana monitoring:
```python
logger.info("email_queue_process: Manual processing completed - %d emails processed", 
    processed_count,
    extra={
        'function': 'sys_email_queue_process',
        'action': 'manual_trigger', 
        'result': 'success',
        'emails_processed': processed_count
    })
```

## Cron Integration

### Recommended Crontab Configuration:
```bash
# Send queued emails every minute
* * * * * cd /app && python manage.py send_queued_mail >> /var/log/email_queue.log 2>&1

# Cleanup old emails weekly on Sunday at 2 AM  
0 2 * * 0 cd /app && python manage.py cleanup_mail --days=90 >> /var/log/email_cleanup.log 2>&1
```

### Benefits:
