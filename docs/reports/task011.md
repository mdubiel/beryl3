# Task 011 Report: Fix Chip and Icon Visibility

## Task Description
Chip and icon for text change is barely visible, it should be rather darker. Ensure both chips (text change and user avatar are aligned). Make the border of both close to black, always use semantic color definitions. and the text with one of highlight colors. Background should blend with main background.

## Analysis
Investigated the header navigation in `templates/base.html` and identified:

1. **Font Selector Chip** (lines 142-145): Used `bg-secondary/20` and `text-secondary` which were too light and barely visible
2. **User Avatar** (lines 177-179): Needed better alignment and consistent border styling with the font chip

## Changes Made

### File: `/home/mdubiel/projects/beryl3/webapp/templates/base.html`

#### Font Selector Chip (lines 142-145)
- **Before**: `bg-secondary/20` background, `text-secondary` icon color, `rounded` corners
- **After**: 
  - Background: `bg-base-200` (blends with main background)
  - Border: `border border-neutral` (close to black as requested)
  - Icon color: `text-primary` (highlight color)
  - Shape: `rounded-full` (consistent with avatar)

#### User Avatar (lines 177-179)
- **Before**: `w-8 rounded-full` without explicit height or border
- **After**:
  - Size: `w-8 h-8` (explicit height for perfect alignment)
  - Border: `border border-neutral` (matching font chip)
  - Image: Added `rounded-full` to image for consistent clipping

## Verification Steps
1. ✅ Used semantic DaisyUI color definitions (`bg-base-200`, `border-neutral`, `text-primary`)
2. ✅ Made chip darker and more visible with proper contrast
3. ✅ Ensured both chips are aligned with consistent 8x8 sizing
4. ✅ Added borders close to black using `border-neutral`
5. ✅ Used highlight color `text-primary` for the icon
6. ✅ Background blends with main using `bg-base-200`

## Outcome
Successfully improved visibility and alignment of both the font selector chip and user avatar in the header navigation. Both elements now have consistent styling with proper contrast and semantic color usage.
