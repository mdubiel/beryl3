# Task 6 Report: Fix /sys/email-queue Error 500

## Task Description
When accessing `/sys/email-queue` I got Error 500.

## Analysis
The Error 500 was caused by two main issues in the email queue implementation:

### Issue 1: Invalid Database Field References
The email queue view was referencing non-existent fields in the post-office Email model:
- `sent` field was referenced but doesn't exist in the model
- `modified` field was referenced but doesn't exist in the model

**Available fields in Email model**: attachments, backend_alias, bcc, cc, context, created, expires_at, from_email, headers, html_message, id, last_updated, logs, message, message_id, number_of_retries, priority, recipient_delivery_status, scheduled_time, status, subject, template, template_id, to

### Issue 2: Invalid Lucide Icons
Several template references used non-existent Lucide icons:
- `bar-chart-3` (in sidebar)
- `check-circle` (in email queue template)
- `x-circle` (in email queue template)

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Database Field References
**File**: `/home/mdubiel/projects/beryl3/webapp/web/views/sys.py`

**Lines 1990-1991**: Changed from:
```python
last_sent_email = Email.objects.filter(status=0).order_by('-sent').first()  # sent
last_failed_email = Email.objects.filter(status=1).order_by('-modified').first()  # failed
```

To:
```python
last_sent_email = Email.objects.filter(status=0).order_by('-last_updated').first()  # sent
last_failed_email = Email.objects.filter(status=1).order_by('-last_updated').first()  # failed
```

### 2. Fixed Template Field References
**File**: `/home/mdubiel/projects/beryl3/webapp/templates/sys/email_queue.html`

**Line 88**: Changed from:
```django
{{ last_sent_email.sent|date:"M d, Y H:i:s" }}
```

To:
```django
{{ last_sent_email.last_updated|date:"M d, Y H:i:s" }}
```

**Line 98**: Changed from:
```django
{{ last_failed_email.modified|date:"M d, Y H:i:s" }}
```

To:
```django
{{ last_failed_email.last_updated|date:"M d, Y H:i:s" }}
```

**Line 209**: Changed from:
```django
{% if email.sent %}{{ email.sent|date:"M d H:i" }}{% else %}-{% endif %}
```

To:
```django
{% if email.status == 0 %}{{ email.last_updated|date:"M d H:i" }}{% else %}-{% endif %}
```

### 3. Fixed Invalid Lucide Icons
**File**: `/home/mdubiel/projects/beryl3/webapp/templates/base_sys.html`

**Line 127**: Changed from:
```django
{% lucide 'bar-chart-3' size=14 class='inline mr-2' %} Grafana
```

To:
```django
{% lucide 'activity' size=14 class='inline mr-2' %} Grafana
```

**File**: `/home/mdubiel/projects/beryl3/webapp/templates/sys/email_queue.html`

**Line 45**: Changed from:
```django
{% lucide 'check-circle' size=24 class='text-success' %}
```

To:
```django
{% lucide 'check' size=24 class='text-success' %}
```

**Line 57**: Changed from:
```django
{% lucide 'x-circle' size=24 class='text-error' %}
```

To:
```django
{% lucide 'x' size=24 class='text-error' %}
```

## Verification Steps
1. ✅ Tested database connection independently - successful
2. ✅ Verified post-office Email model fields using Django shell
3. ✅ Identified exact error location through stack trace analysis
4. ✅ Fixed database field references in both view and template
5. ✅ Fixed all invalid Lucide icon references
6. ✅ Tested email queue view programmatically - successful (HTTP 200)
7. ✅ Confirmed email queue displays correctly with proper data

## Final Test Results
```
Email queue status: 200
✅ Email queue view works correctly!
Content length: 26985 bytes
Email queue is now accessible!
```

## Outcome
Task 6 completed successfully. The `/sys/email-queue` Error 500 has been resolved. The email queue management interface is now fully functional with:

- ✅ Proper database field references using `last_updated` 
- ✅ Valid Lucide icons rendering correctly
- ✅ Full email statistics display (3 emails currently in queue)
- ✅ Queue management controls working
- ✅ Recent emails list displaying properly

The email queue view now provides comprehensive email management functionality including queue processing, cleanup tools, and detailed email statistics as originally intended.
