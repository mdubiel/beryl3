# Task 003 Report: Add External Services to SYS Sidebar

## Task Description
Add external services to the SYS sidebar that should point to "resend" service, Adminer, Grafana and other available services used in this application.

## Analysis
Upon examination of the current `/sys/` sidebar in `base_sys.html`, I found the External Services section already included most services:
- ✅ **Database Admin** (likely Adminer) - via `EXTERNAL_DB_URL`
- ✅ **Inbucket** (email testing) - via `EXTERNAL_INBUCKET_URL`  
- ✅ **Monitoring** - via `EXTERNAL_MONITORING_URL`
- ✅ **Sentry** (error tracking) - via `EXTERNAL_SENTRY_URL`
- ✅ **Grafana** (dashboards) - via `EXTERNAL_GRAFANA_URL`
- ✅ **Loki** (log aggregation) - via `EXTERNAL_LOKI_URL`
- ❌ **Resend** (email service) - MISSING

The main gap was the Resend service, which is actively used for email delivery in the application.

## Services Available in Infrastructure

From the docker-compose.yaml analysis, the application uses these external services:
1. **PostgreSQL** - Database (accessible via Database Admin link)
2. **Inbucket** - Email testing tool (already linked)
3. **Grafana** - Monitoring dashboards (already linked)
4. **Loki** - Log aggregation (already linked)
5. **Redis** - Caching (no web UI by default)
6. **Resend** - Production email service (was missing)

## Changes Made

### 1. **Django Settings Configuration**
- `webapp/webapp/settings.py`: Added `EXTERNAL_RESEND_URL` to environment variable definitions
- Added assignment: `EXTERNAL_RESEND_URL = env('EXTERNAL_RESEND_URL') if env('EXTERNAL_RESEND_URL') else None`

### 2. **Context Processor Update**
- `webapp/web/context_processors.py`: Added `EXTERNAL_RESEND_URL` to the `external_services()` context processor
- Makes the Resend URL available globally to all templates

### 3. **SYS Sidebar Template Update**  
- `webapp/templates/base_sys.html`: Added conditional Resend service link in External Services section
- Used mail icon (lucide 'mail') for visual consistency
- Added external link indicator

## Implementation Details

### Settings Configuration:
```python
# Environment variable definition
EXTERNAL_RESEND_URL=(str, ''),

# Variable assignment
EXTERNAL_RESEND_URL = env('EXTERNAL_RESEND_URL') if env('EXTERNAL_RESEND_URL') else None
```

### Context Processor Addition:
```python
return {
    # ... existing services
    'EXTERNAL_RESEND_URL': getattr(settings, 'EXTERNAL_RESEND_URL', None),
}
```

### Template Integration:
```html
{% if EXTERNAL_RESEND_URL %}
<a href="{{ EXTERNAL_RESEND_URL }}" target="_blank" class="terminal-menu-item block px-3 py-2 text-sm terminal-text">
    {% lucide 'mail' size=14 class='inline mr-2' %} Resend
    {% lucide 'link' size=10 class='inline ml-1 opacity-60' %}
</a>
{% endif %}
```

## External Service Coverage

After this task, the SYS sidebar now provides access to all major external services:

| Service | Purpose | Icon | Status |
|---------|---------|------|---------|
| Database Admin | PostgreSQL management (Adminer/pgAdmin) | database | ✅ |
| Inbucket | Email testing interface | inbox | ✅ |
| Monitoring | System monitoring dashboard | activity | ✅ |
| Sentry | Error tracking and alerting | shield | ✅ |
| Grafana | Metrics and log dashboards | activity | ✅ |
| Loki | Log aggregation query interface | file-text | ✅ |
| **Resend** | **Email service management** | **mail** | ✅ **NEW** |

## Environment Variable Configuration

To enable the Resend link, set the environment variable:
```bash
EXTERNAL_RESEND_URL=https://resend.com/dashboard
```

Or for staging/production deployments, add to the environment configuration:
```
EXTERNAL_RESEND_URL=https://resend.com/dashboard
```

## Verification Steps
1. ✅ Added EXTERNAL_RESEND_URL to settings.py environment definitions
2. ✅ Added EXTERNAL_RESEND_URL assignment in settings.py
3. ✅ Updated context processor to include EXTERNAL_RESEND_URL
4. ✅ Added Resend service link to base_sys.html template
5. ✅ Used consistent styling and icons with existing services
6. ✅ Added conditional rendering (only shows if URL is configured)
7. ✅ Added external link indicator for user clarity

## Outcome
✅ **Task Completed Successfully**

The SYS sidebar now includes comprehensive access to all external services used by the Beryl3 application:
- **Enhanced admin experience**: Direct access to Resend email service management
- **Consistent interface**: Follows existing design patterns and icons
- **Flexible configuration**: Only displays when environment variable is set
- **Complete service coverage**: All major external services now accessible

The external services section is now complete and provides administrators with convenient access to all the tools needed to manage and monitor the Beryl3 application.

## Files Modified
- `webapp/webapp/settings.py` - Added EXTERNAL_RESEND_URL configuration
- `webapp/web/context_processors.py` - Added EXTERNAL_RESEND_URL to context
- `webapp/templates/base_sys.html` - Added Resend service link

## Next Steps
1. Configure EXTERNAL_RESEND_URL environment variable in deployment environments
2. Optionally add other service links as needed (Redis management tools, etc.)
3. Task is complete and ready for testing
