# The Ultimate Task List

Important! - for generic agent behaviour always consult CLAUDE.md file.

Proceed one by one with listed tasks. Before making changes, create a plan to review. If task is too big, divide it to smaller parts.
For each task, create a branch - do implementation (after review) and then commit changes to this branch. Then ask me to verify the implementation on the local dev environment (write to the console summary and what I should test), also update task summary with the same information.
When testing is completed merge a branch to main, and commit all changes.
Do not push changes to repository (I'll do the same) and do not execute any scripts, especially for production. Do this only when explicitly asked.
After commit is completed, update the task with commit ID.

In this file @TODO.md keep table of contents, and drafted tasks. If the drafted task has no index number add this number over next iteration.
All completed tasks documentation is stored in `docs/reports/taskXXX.md` files.

## ‚è≥ In Progress Tasks

### Task 45: Add Filtering Options in Collection View

**Status:** ‚è≥ In progress (partially completed)

**Description:**
Add filtering options in collection view to limit number of displayed items

Add a field for item "Your Id" and "location".

Location is another model, when user first time create a location, new entry is created. Later, when user is selecting location it has two options from select field: new entry or select one of this existing locations. Selecting existing should point to existing entryn in location tables. This should be displayed with autocompletion (combo box) when user edit item and try to select location. Location edition is available only in /items/<hash>/edit view.
Available locations should be visible in new view /locations/ and availabe from user pop-up menu. It should only display list of locations with number of items assigned and query to virtual collection list showing tiems belonging to this location.
Display location and your Id, as another attribute but visible only to user (not visible in public view)

---

### Task 57: Add Autocompletion for Item Attributes

**Status:** Pending

**Description:**
When adding or editing item attribute the system (with HX) should try to autocomplete that information (min. 3 characters, search anywhere in the string). For autocomplete data you need to query CollectionItemAttributeValue for the items user own, and are the same type.

**Example:**
When I'm trying to add to the 'book' the 'Author' attribute it should look up for all CollectionItemAttributeValue records where user is an owner, and are the records are type 'Author' referenced to book item attribute.
Then, similar like in task 50, it should autocomplete this value, pointing to existing entry to the database to avoid duplicates with same value. If value for current user is unknown then create new one.

**Technical Requirements:**
- HTMX endpoint for autocomplete
- Min 3 characters to trigger
- Search user's existing values
- Filter by item type
- Fuzzy matching
- Fast response (<100ms)

---

### Task 60: Fix Layout of Item Type Popup and Items Order

**Status:** Pending

**Description:**
Layout of item type popup and items order.

The number of item types is too big, and it is very hard to make it fully visible on the page. the displayed dialog must be dynamic and fit into visible area (currently is too wide, and expand out of the visible area). It can be centered, eventually modal if there is no good way to make it happened, howevere I would insist to use flexibility of 'flex' utility. Also, the items inside this dialog should be sorted alphabetically and sorted from top to bottom (not left to right as it is now)

---

### Task 61: Geographic Access Restrictions

**Status:** Pending

**Original Description:**
Prevent users from specific countries (configurable as env variable) to access the application. Silently fail or redirect to their country intelligence agency. It is supposed to protect application and be mcompliant with the law from the possible users from selected countries.

---

### Task 62: Dynamic Background Images for Public Collections

**Status:** üìã Planned, it should be completed - verify

**Description:**
For public view of Collection, if the collection, and items in that collection have images - use randomly selected one of it to set as a background. Background should be fixed (do not move when scrolling) and fill entire view.

**Requirements:**
- Random image selection from collection/items
- Fixed background (CSS `background-attachment: fixed`)
- Full viewport coverage
- Overlay for text readability
- Performance optimized
- Fallback when no images available

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Modify `public_collection_view` to collect all images
2. Select random image and pass to template
3. Update template with CSS background styling
4. Add semi-transparent overlay for readability
5. Test with various image sizes and aspect ratios

**Files to Modify:**
- `webapp/web/views/public.py` - Add image collection logic
- `webapp/templates/public/collection_public_detail.html` - Add background styling

---
## Task
 We are still using placeholders for images? Review entire codebase and remove them.

## Task 33 Additional Requirements

**Status:** Pending (base implementation completed)

These enhancements extend the content moderation system (Task 33):

### Image URL Logic

**Requirement:**
When displaying images, verify moderation status:
- If approved or not flagged: return regular image URL
- For user content when flagged: return 'error image' URL
- Same applies to thumbnails
- For SYS content moderation: normal URL but blurred

**Implementation Needed:**
- Template tag or model method: `get_safe_image_url()`
- Returns appropriate URL based on status
- Handles thumbnails same way
